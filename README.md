# Css Typer
This is a clicker type game that i have made for fun and to learn more about JS and stuff like that. 

## Running the website
The website is run using express, and is pretty simple to set up. First you need to download [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download), and make sure to add it to path. 
Then open the project in Visual Studio Code, and run 
```bash
npm i express nodemon
```
This downloads all the packages you need, and now you can run it with
```bash
npm run dev
```
